# Python Data Analysis on Sales Data
## Project Description
-This project involves analyzing a sales dataset to derive basic insights using Python. The primary tools used are the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for creating visualizations. The analysis focuses on grouping sales data by product and calculating the total sales for each, which is then visualized using a bar chart.



## This task was completed as part of the 

Python Developer Internship from Elevate Labs.


# Tools and Libraries
## Python 

## Pandas 

## Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab 

## Matplotlib (for plotting)

# Key Concepts Covered
## Pandas DataFrame: Using the primary Pandas data structure to hold and manipulate the sales data.



## Data Aggregation: Applying the groupby() and sum() methods to aggregate data and extract meaningful insights.

## Data Visualization: Creating charts from the data to present findings clearly.
